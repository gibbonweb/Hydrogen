/**
 * Model provides a baseline for how Model classes should be constructed.
 * It offers no data manipulation functionality of its own, but includes
 * two patterns that should be used in every extending class: the singleton
 * pattern (letting only one instance of each Model-extending class exist) and
 * the MagicCacheable pattern (allowing the return value of functions to be
 * cached, based on what those functions are named).
 *
 * Model-extending classes should never be instantiated with the 'new' keyword.
 * Rather, an instance should be gotten with the {@link #getInstance} method,
 * like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $userModel = \myapp\UserModel::getInstance();
 * </pre>
 *
 * For instructions on how to name functions within the extended Model to
 * allow their result to be cached automatically, see
 * {@link hydrogen\common\MagicCacheable}.
