	 * modules, including PDO.  Unlike traditional (and dated) query methods, prepared
	 * queries are immune to SQL injection if used properly.
	 * 
	 * Any dynamic element in an SQL query should be replaced with a question mark (?) or
	 * a variable name preceded by a colon (:varname) -- but only one type of replacement
	 * within the same query.  Note, however, that only variable values can be replaced.
	 * For example, the following are legal, preparable queries:
	 * 
	 * <code>SELECT customer FROM orders WHERE total > ? AND product = ?
	 * INSERT INTO orders (customer, product, total) VALUES (:cust, :prod, :total)</code>
	 * 
	 * These queries, however, are not legal and cannot be prepared:
	 * <code>SELECT customer FROM orders WHERE total > ? AND product = :prod
	 * SELECT ? FROM orders LIMIT 1</code>
	 * 
	 * The exception to this rule is if a query is prepared using a {@link Query}
	 * object, which supports both replacement types simultaneously.
	 *
	 * Once prepared, the values for the replaced items can be passed in when the
	 * query is executed.  This method returns a {@link DatabaseStatement} object,
