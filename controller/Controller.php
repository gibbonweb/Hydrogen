/**
 * Controller provides a baseline for how Controller classes should be
 * constructed.  It offers no data manipulation functionality of its own, but
 * includes two patterns that should be used in every extending class: the
 * singleton pattern (letting only one instance of each Controller-extending
 * class exist) and the MagicCacheable pattern (allowing controller functions'
 * output to be cached, based on what those functions are named).
 *
 * Controller-extending classes should never be instantiated with the 'new'
 * keyword.  Rather, an instance should be gotten with the {@link #getInstance}
 * method, like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * $blogCtrl = \myapp\BlogController::getInstance();
 * </pre>
 *
 * For instructions on how to name functions within the extended Controller to
 * allow their output to be cached automatically, see
 * {@link hydrogen\common\MagicCacheable}.
 *
 * When the "Cached" version of a function is called and no cached data is
 * found for that key, Controller executes the function and listens to any
 * output to stdout for its duration.  This output is cached along with the
 * function's return value.
 *
 * Similarly, when cached data is found, that data is immediately sent to
 * stdout (in most cases, the web browser) and the cached return value
 * (if any) is returned.  It will respect all currently active buffering.
