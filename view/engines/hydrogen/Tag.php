/**
 * Tags in the Hydrogen Templating Engine are blocks of simple code or
 * complex logic that can be executed with a string inside of a template.
 * Template tags have two parts: The first is the Tag class itself (or, more
 * accurately, a class extending this abstract Tag class) and acts as an
 * extension of the Hydrogen {@link \hydrogen\view\engines\hydrogen\Parser}
 * class.  It's called when a tag is encountered in the template, is given
 * the information about the tag with a reference to the Parser instance, and
 * is expected to utilize those tools to produce the second part of a tag:
 * the {@link \hydrogen\view\engines\hydrogen\Node}.
 *
 * Nodes are independent bits of the parsed template that can be called upon
 * to produce raw PHP code.  When executed, that PHP code should produce the
 * output expected for its part of the template.  The Tag's role is simply to
 * create and return a Node instance (or, again more accurately, an instance
 * of a class implementing the Node interface), or boolean false if the tag
 * should produce no output in the template itself.
 *
 * To achieve this goal, Tags are allowed to parse through the tag arguments
 * as well as utilize the Parser instance (including calling the Parser's
 * parse() method to collect other Nodes) to collect and format all data
 * necessary to instantiate the appropriate Node instance.
